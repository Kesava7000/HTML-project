<h1>Tenkasi days:Sridhar vembu's Global Village</h1>
<ul class="font">
<li>The soul of India lives in its villages declared Mahatma Gandhi nearly a century ago.</li>
<li>But it was the cities that moved the wheels of commerce and where the talent and spotlight shifted.</li>
<li>Until Sridhar Vembu, the charismatic founder of Zoho Corp, took it upon himself to prove that the village could be a coding hub of creativity and commerce.</li>
<li>Vembu, recently awarded the Padma Shri award, argues that it was a decision based on first principles to move to a rural outpost near Tenkasi in southern Tamil Nadu nearly a decade ago, and no quixotic ideals.</li>
<li>Cities were getting crowded, polluted, facing water shortage and things needed to change.</li>
<li>But it’s taken a pandemic during which work from anywhere became an accepted notion to prove how far-sighted was his premise.</li>
<li>Vembu may have caught the world’s attention with his unique approach to location, as well as talent (skilling and empowering local rural youth, and challenging them to create world class software) but equally the products tumbling out of the software chest of Zoho Corp have created buzz too.</li>
<li>The core promise of Zoho is to serve the underserved,” he says.</li>
<li>This reflects in both its talent philosophy and product philosophy, where the approach is to provide an alternative.</li>
<li>People are always looking for alternatives - for three reasons.</li>
<li>One they are curious and want to see what is being offered.</li>
<li>Second is privacy.</li>
<li>Third – they may want better products.And we do have better products,” he asserts.</li>
<li>Gone are the days when Zoho was mainly a CRM (customer relationship management) player pitching itself against Salesforce. </li>
<li>Today, it is in the full productivity /collaboration suite where Microsoft and Google play with its Zoho Mail, Zoho Cliq (the Slack equivalent), Zoho Meeting (against MS Teams and Google Meeting) and so on. </li>
<li>In December, taking everyone by surprise, it even unveiled a local alternative to Whatsapp with its chat offering Arattai (which means chat in Tamil).</li>
<li>Vembu says Zoho will be ready to formally launch the app in the next few weeks and privacy is at the centre of its promise.</li>
<li>As for the expansion of its product offerings to encompass the full workflow range, he says, Zoho now calls itself the Operating System for Business.</li>
<li>We think this will be the big theme in the next five years. We anticipated that the front office, the back office, the collaborative software all have to be one integrated suite.</li>
<li>And that’s what we call Zoho One,” he explains.</li></h2>
