the temple is believed to have been built by Pandyan ruler Parakrama Pandyan during the 13th century,with later additions from Madurai Nayaks.<br>

</p>
<h1>PAPANASAM FALLS</h1>
<p>
Agasthiyar Falls is located close to Papanasam in Tirunelveli district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.<br>
The falls is located on the Western Ghats and to the south of Papanasam lower,<br> 
the lake from where Tamiraparani River originates. It is located 42 km from the nearest city Tirunelveli.<br>
Location: Papanasam, Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu
<h1>SRI SANKARA NARAYANA SWAMY TEMPLE</h1>
<p>
The temple is dedicated to Sankaranarayanar, who is the combined manifestation of Shiva and Vishnu.<br>
This temple was built by Ukkira Pandiya Thevar in the 11th century AD. This temple also called as Avudaiamman Kovil or Davasu Kovil.<br>
According to mythology, once the devotees of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva quarreled with each other to determine whose god is powerful.<br>
Then Lord Shiva appeared as Sankaranarayanar to mark his devotees to understand that both Hari and Shiva are one and the same.<br>
So it is held sacred by Saivites and Vaishnavites as well. Hence this temple depicts the concept of Hari and Haran being one God.<br>
<h1>KARUPPANADHI DAM</h1>
<p>
The Karuppanadhi Dam is located at the foot hills of Western Ghats built across the <br>
Karuppanadhi river near Chokkampatti, in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, southern India.<br>
It provides water for irrigation to the region of Kadayanallur Taluk.<br>
</p>
<h1>FIVE FALLS</h1>
<p>The thing that all of these waterfalls had in common was that they apparently had Ayurvedic healing properties<br>
since their streams were said to pass through groves of naturally growing herbs with medicinal properties.<br>
In fact, I was told that some doctors even recommended bathing in these Ayurvedic waterfalls as treatment.<br>
And since we thought India was well-known for producing doctors, maybe they were onto something.</p>
<h1>THENALAI DAM</h1>
<p>The Thenmala dam is the second largest irrigation project in Kerala,near Tenkasi India.<br> 
It impounds the longest reservoir in the state and water from the reservoir is also used for power generation. <br>
The dam was started in 1961 under the Kallada Irrigation and Tree Crop development project with an original cost of Rs. 13.28 crores.<br></p>
<h1>FIVE FALLS</h1>
<p>The Kutralam Five Falls (or Coutrallam Five Falls) was one of the cluster of about nine waterfalls that Julie and I understood to be collectively known as the Courtallam Falls.<br>
I’d imagine that this collective was named as such because they were all near the town of Courtallam (pronounced “kor-TAH-lum”; also known as Kutralam).<br>
The thing that all of these waterfalls had in common was that they apparently had Ayurvedic healing properties since their streams were said to pass through groves of naturally growing herbs with medicinal properties.<br>
